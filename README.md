 Power BI Cricket Analysis Dashboard  

 Project Overview  
This project is a Power BI dashboard designed to provide insights and analysis of cricket data. The dashboard showcases various visualizations, such as batting and bowling performance, player statistics, team comparisons, and historical match data. It allows users to interact with the data and gain valuable insights into cricket performance trends. Data preprocessing was performed using Pandas to clean and organize the dataset before importing it into Power BI for visualization.

 Features  
- Interactive dashboard with various charts and graphs.  
- Displays player statistics, team performance, and match insights.  
- Allows drill-down capabilities for in-depth analysis of individual players and teams.  
- Visualizes batting and bowling performance trends over time.  
- Data preprocessing using Pandas to clean and structure the dataset.

 Technologies Used  
- Power BI: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.  
- Pandas (Python): For data preprocessing, cleaning, and structuring the dataset.    
- Visualizations: Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables to display performance metrics.  

 Data Preprocessing  
Before importing the data into Power BI, Pandas was used for preprocessing the dataset. The key preprocessing steps included:  
- Handling missing or incomplete data.  
- Converting data types for consistency.  
- Removing or correcting erroneous data points.  
- Aggregating and restructuring data to enhance visualization.  

 Data Source  
The dataset used in this project contains historical cricket match data, including player statistics (batting and bowling), team performance, and match results.  


 Setup Instructions    

1. Open the 'PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix' file in Power BI Desktop.  

2. Load the preprocessed data 'preprocessed_data.csv' by connecting the CSV file in Power BI.  

3. View and interact with the dashboard to explore cricket performance insights.  

 Usage  
- Explore various visualizations to compare player and team performance.  
- Use filters and slicers to drill down into specific match or player data.  
- Analyze trends over time to identify patterns in batting and bowling performance.
